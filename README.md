# Global AI Safety Notary: A Decentralised Protocol for International AI Incident Reporting

**Global AI Safety Notary** is a decentralised incident reporting platform that creates immutable, verifiable records of AI safety incidents on the blockchain. Built on the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), the platform enables researchers, developers, and organisations to report and track AI failures—including bias, hallucinations, safety violations, and data leaks—with full transparency and accountability.

## The Problem

International AI governance suffers from a fundamental trust deficit. Nations are reluctant to report AI safety incidents to centralised bodies controlled by potential adversaries, creating dangerous information silos where critical safety lessons go unshared.

## Key Features

- **Immutable Incident Records:** Every report is stored as an on-chain attestation on Ethereum Sepolia, ensuring records cannot be altered or deleted
- **Structured Reporting:** Multi-step form capturing incident type, severity (1-5), model identifier, organization, location, and detailed descriptions
- **Searchable Registry:** Browse, filter, and search all reported incidents by type, severity, or keywords
- **Blockchain Verification:** Direct links to EASScan for independent verification of attestation data

## Why It Matters

As AI systems become more prevalent, tracking their failures transparently is critical for building trust and improving safety. This platform provides a decentralized, tamper-proof record that holds AI systems accountable while enabling the safety research community to learn from incidents globally.
